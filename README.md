# HWS Configs

## Info

HWS Configs have the goal to enrich the Multiplayer gaming experience, because the Vanilla Config files have the focus on Singleplayer. 
My focus is performance and fun, hence some values may differ from Vanilla.

I value feedback, so the Config files are constantly changing based on the Community interaction with the Config files.

The main intention for this repository is for HWS players to test and work with the HWS Configs for HWS.

Other Server Owners may use my HWS Configs by giving proper credit.

## Setup

1. Unzip the files
2. Put the files in Content/Configuration or in your Content/Scenarios/YourScenario/Content/Configuration

**WARNING:** This will overwrite the Vanilla Configuration and with that the Vanilla game experience! 

## Effectiveness Weapon System (EWS)

HWS uses a detailed Rock-Paper-Scissors principle for Weapons and Materials. A spreadsheet about it can be found here:

## Contribution

I credit Vermillion for his Reforged Galaxy Config from which I might take inspirations and parts.

Pull requests are welcome, if you describe what your goal of your change is and how it could benefit the gameplay on HWS.
